Welcome to Asharaful Tip calculator.

In this webpage, I use the Html, CSS and JavaScript.

For the Html Part I use the meta tag, the favicon, h1, h2, div, form, button,
link and script.

On the CSS file, I mostly use this to work on the background color, the size of text, format of the border.

I also add the PNG file of calculator for the icon.

Lastly, on JavaScript, I did all the calculation for the tip calculator.
